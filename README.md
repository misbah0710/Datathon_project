# Datathon_project
The project was aasigned from data for good chapter. A global count data set was given, the aim of this data set was to take the insights from the survey data. 
The survey was related to the issues woaman and other gender identities facing globally. This was a group project and part of my work is posted above in the notebook file, the notebook file Data_cleaning seems to be longer to render on github but can be sent on a special request
The total reposiotry hasn't been uploaded beacuse of the data sensitivity.
